#Collector 

A Web Based Scrapbook 

Collector is a dynamic alternative to bookmarking for people who love collecting stuff on the web. If you're the type of person who always keeps a *lot* of tabs open, or who has multiple carefully curated bookmarks folders, this Collector is an option that adds a little zest and fun to your organizing. 

To get started, you simply create a 'Board' that represents a theme––say great soccer players. 
And then inside of that board, you collect information relevant to that theme, like links to wikipedia pages for Catarina Macario, Megan Rapinoe and Kylian Mbappè. This individual bits of information are called 'memories', and each memory includes a name and description. You can be as detailed as you like with your descriptions. 

In future updates, you'll be able to upload your own images, files etc, but for now you simply collect links and add more information about them.
